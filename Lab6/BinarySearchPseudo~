1. If the list has no integers, target can't be found and is finished.

2. Let m be the middle element in the list.

3. If m is equal to the integer were looking for then finished.

4. If m is greater than the targt integer, then recur to step 1 using all values smaller than m as the new list.

5. Otherwise recur to step one using all values greater than m as our list.
